## About ShiftyBoi
Goal: Shift yourself from the starting point to the door on the right.

Avoid the ShiftMuncher ![alt text](https://github.com/SanBaiKuai/SanBaiKuai/blob/master/Assets/Sprites/shiftmuncher%20for%20github.png "ShiftMuncher") and collect as many Shifts ![alt text](https://github.com/SanBaiKuai/SanBaiKuai/blob/master/Assets/Sprites/s_bleegaunt_move.png "Shift") as possible before entering the door.
